# UWO AERO Design - Onboarding Repository
Welcome to the Western Aero Design Team! The following series will contain a variety of items such as instructions, tutorials, and onboarding materials for students to use and get started with Git and Github.

This repository is structured as collection of tutorials. Each tutorial and all its accompanying material will be placed inside one folder. The folder can be found at the top level of this repository. This means that a tutorial will never have another tutorial within and so you should not have to search hard for anything.

## **I Want to Complete a Tutorial**
To start a tutorial, find which one you would like to complete in the list of [current tutorials](#current-tutorials). There will be a link to the tutorial in the list. 

After selecting a tutorial start at the README.md within the tutorial folder. This file should contain the written instruction for the tutorial. Other files within the tutorial folder will either be accompanying material or examples for you to work through.

Tutorials may require that you push code back to the repository, to do that you need permission. To get permission look for the one of the Team Leads of Aero Design, probably through the team's current communication method (currently microsoft teams but could change in the future).

## **I Want to Create a Tutorial**
If you think there is a tutorial you would like to create and would useful for the team, talk to one of the Team Leads about it for feedback, and ideas. 

If you decide to start creating the tutorial make sure you follow the same structure of previous tutorials such as:
* Add the name to the list with a link
* Ideally, any example that you expect the person to work through should not require them to undo the work afterwards for the next person.
* README.md is the file with the instructions
* README.md should also contain what knowledge is needed to complete the tutorial and possibly references/videos to fill in that knowledge if possible.
* README.md should include a rough time estimate
* README.md should also list what the person can expect to learn near the beginning
* Get someone other than yourself to run through the tutorial. This will help identify any areas where your tutorial may be hard to understand.
