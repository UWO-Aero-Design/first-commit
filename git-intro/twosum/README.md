# **TwoSum**

A collection of TwoSum programs written in different languages for the UWO Aero Design Team to use for git onboarding tasks.

TwoSum is a program that attempts to find the indicies of an array where the values at those indicies add up to a given target number. 

If no two values add up to the target, then "no solution" is printed to the console. If a solution exists, the indicies and their values should be printed to the screen.
