# **FizzBuzz**

A collection of FizzBuzz programs written in different languages for the UWO Aero Design Team to use for git onboarding tasks.

FizzBuzz is a program that iterates through a set of values, and prints fizz on all values that are multiples of an integer x1 and buzz on all values that are multiples of an integer x2.

When the value is a multiple of both x1 and x2, fizzbuzz should be printed. Finally, if not printing any of the above, the current value should be printed.
